### Fixed
- **Bun-compiled binary support**: Fixed spawning teammates when pi is compiled as a Bun binary (#10)
  - Added `getPiLaunchCommand()` helper to detect and handle Bun-compiled binaries
  - Bun binaries have `process.argv[1]` pointing to virtual `/$bunfs/root/pi` path
  - Now uses `process.execPath` which works for both compiled binaries and regular Node environments
  - Fixes "node /$bunfs/root/pi" error when spawning teammates in compiled mode

## [0.9.8] - 2025-03-17

### Added
- **Save Teams as Templates**: Convert runtime teams into reusable predefined team templates (#7)
  - New `save_team_as_template` tool to save any runtime team as a template
  - New `list_runtime_teams` tool to see available teams that can be saved
  - Creates agent definition files (`.md`) with frontmatter for each teammate
  - Updates `teams.yaml` with the new template entry
  - Supports both `user` (global) and `project` (local) scope
  - Enables the workflow: Create → Use → Save → Reuse

### Changed
- Updated README with comprehensive documentation for the save-to-template workflow

### Added

  - New `cleanupAgentSessionFolders()` utility function to remove stale `~/.pi/agent/teams/` entries
  - `team_shutdown` now automatically cleans up agent sessions older than 1 hour
  - New `cleanup_agent_sessions` tool for manual cleanup with configurable max age
  - Prevents accumulation of orphaned agent session folders (186+ folders were found in some environments)

## [0.9.6] - 2025-03-17

### Added
- **Predefined Teams**: Define reusable team templates in `teams.yaml` files (#6)
  - Create `~/.pi/teams.yaml` (global) or `.pi/teams.yaml` (project-local) to define team presets

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Team leads now automatically subscribe to their inbox and poll for messages (#9)
- Leads no longer need to call `spawn_lead_window` just to receive messages from teammates
- Lead session is registered via PID tracking when `team_create` is called

### Changed
- Inbox polling now runs for both team leads and teammates (any agent with team context)
- Added `findLeadTeamForSession()` to detect lead membership without environment variables
